    "## Question F.1\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a function $f : \\mathbb{R}^N \\ni {\\bf x} \\mapsto {\\bf x}'B{\\bf x} \\in \\mathbb{R}$, where $N \\times N$ matrix $B$ is square but not symmetric.\n",
    "Show that the same function can be represented as ${\\bf x}'A{\\bf x}$ where $A$ is symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{hint}\n",
    "Recall that the definition of a quadratic form calls for the symmetry of matrix $A$. This exercise shows that this assumption is without loss of generality.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{hint}\n",
    "Given a square matrix $M$, you can use the identity $M = \\tfrac{1}{2}(M+M') + \\tfrac{1}{2}(M-M')$ where the first component is symmetric and the second is not symmetric.\n",

    "## Question F.2\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a quadratic form $f : \\mathbb{R}^N \\ni {\\bf x} \\mapsto {\\bf x}'A{\\bf x} \\in \\mathbb{R}$, where $N \\times N$ matrix $A$ is symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the product rule of multivariate calculus, derive the gradient and Hessian of $f$. Make sure that all multiplied vectors and matrices are conformable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{hint}\n",
    "You can assume that ${\\bf x}$ is a column vector, and that any vector function of ${\\bf x}$ is also a column vector.\n",

    "## Question F.3\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise takes you on a tour of a binary logit model and its properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a model when a decision maker is making a choice between $J=2$ two alternatives, each of which has a pair of characteristic $x_j \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, $j=1,2$. Econometrician observes data on these characteristics and the choice made by the decision maker $y_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$, where $y_i = 1$ denotes that the first alternative was chosen. The data is indexed with $i$ and has $N$ observations, i.e. $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,N\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To rationalize the data the econometrician assumes that the utility of each alternative is given by a scalar product of a vector of parameters $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ and a vector of alternative characteristics $x_j \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, $j=1,2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In line with the random utility model, the econometrician also assumes that the utility of each alternative contains the additively separable random component which has an appropriately centered type I extreme value distribution, such that the choice probabilities for the two alternatives are given by a vector function $p \\colon \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to (0,1) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$\n",
