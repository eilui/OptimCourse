    "## Question F.1\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a function $f : \\mathbb{R}^N \\ni {\\bf x} \\mapsto {\\bf x}'B{\\bf x} \\in \\mathbb{R}$, where $N \\times N$ matrix $B$ is square but not symmetric.\n",
    "Show that the same function can be represented as ${\\bf x}'A{\\bf x}$ where $A$ is symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{hint}\n",
    "Recall that the definition of a quadratic form calls for the symmetry of matrix $A$. This exercise shows that this assumption is without loss of generality.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{hint}\n",
    "Given a square matrix $M$, you can use the identity $M = \\tfrac{1}{2}(M+M') + \\tfrac{1}{2}(M-M')$ where the first component is symmetric and the second is not symmetric.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question F.2\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a quadratic form $f : \\mathbb{R}^N \\ni {\\bf x} \\mapsto {\\bf x}'A{\\bf x} \\in \\mathbb{R}$, where $N \\times N$ matrix $A$ is symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the product rule of multivariate calculus, derive the gradient and Hessian of $f$. Make sure that all multiplied vectors and matrices are conformable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{hint}\n",
    "You can assume that ${\\bf x}$ is a column vector, and that any vector function of ${\\bf x}$ is also a column vector.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question F.3\n",
    "\n",
    "Logit function as a composition of CCP and a scalar product of X and beta as two separate functions"
