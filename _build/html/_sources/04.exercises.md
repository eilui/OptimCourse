# Exercise set C

Please, see the 
[**general comment on the tutorial exercises**](02.exercises.md)

## Question C.1

Limits 

## Question C.2

Show that the Cobb-Douglas production function 
$f(k,l) = k^\alpha l^\beta$ from $[0,\infty) \times [0,\infty)$ to $\mathbb{R}$ is continuous everywhere in its domain.

```{tip}
You can use the fact that, for any $a \in \mathbb{R}$ the function $g(x) = x^a$ is continuous at any $x \in [0,\infty)$. This was mentioned towards the end of lecture 4. 
Also, remember that norm convergence implies element by element convergence.
```

## Question C.3

Let $\beta \in (0,1)$. Show that the utility function $u(c_1,c_2) = \sqrt{c_1} + \beta \sqrt{c_2}$ from $[0,\infty) \times [0,\infty)$ to $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ is continuous everywhere in its domain.

## Question C.4

Let $A$ be the set of all consumption pairs $(c_1,c_2)$ such that $c_1 \ge 0$, $c_2 \ge 0$ and $p_1 c_1 + p_2 c_2 \le M$ Here $p_1$, $p_2$ and $M$ are positive constants. Show that $A$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$.

```{tip}
Weak inequalities are preserved under limits
```

## Question C.5

Let ${\bf x}, {\bf y} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ and $\| {\bf x} \| $ denote the Euclidean norm.  Verify the ***Parallelogram Equality*** given by
%
$$
\| {\bf x} + {\bf y} \|^2 + \| {\bf x} - {\bf y} \|^2 = 2 \big( \| {\bf x} \|^2 + \| {\bf y} \|^2 \big)
$$
