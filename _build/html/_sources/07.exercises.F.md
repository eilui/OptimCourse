# Exercise set F

Please, see the 
[**general comment on the tutorial exercises**](02.exercises.A.md)

## Question F.1

Consider a function $f : \mathbb{R}^N \ni {\bf x} \mapsto {\bf x}'B{\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}$, where $N \times N$ matrix $B$ is square but not symmetric.
Show that the same function can be represented as ${\bf x}'A{\bf x}$ where $A$ is symmetric.

```{hint}
Recall that the definition of a quadratic form calls for the symmetry of matrix $A$. This exercise shows that this assumption is without loss of generality.
```

```{hint}
Given a square matrix $M$, you can use the identity $M = \tfrac{1}{2}(M+M') + \tfrac{1}{2}(M-M')$ where the first component is symmetric and the second is not symmetric.
```

## Question F.2

Consider a quadratic form $f : \mathbb{R}^N \ni {\bf x} \mapsto {\bf x}'A{\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}$, where $N \times N$ matrix $A$ is symmetric.

Using the product rule of multivariate calculus, derive the gradient and Hessian of $f$. Make sure that all multiplied vectors and matrices are conformable.

```{hint}
You can assume that ${\bf x}$ is a column vector, and that any vector function of ${\bf x}$ is also a column vector.
```

## Question F.3

This exercise takes you on a tour of a binary logit model and its properties.
