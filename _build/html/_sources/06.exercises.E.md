# Exercise set E

Please, see the 
[**general comment on the tutorial exercises**](02.exercises.A.md)

## Question E.1

Show that the function $f(x) = - |x|$ from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ is concave.

## Question E.2

Let ${\bf A}$ be the $1 \times 1$ matrix $(a)$. Give a necessary and
sufficient condition on $a$ (that is, an "if and only if" condition on
$a$) under which ${\bf A}$ is nonsingular.

## Question E.3

Consider the function $f$ from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ defined by
%
$$
%
f(x) = (c x)^2 + z
%
$$
%
Give a necessary and sufficient (if and only if) condition on $c$ under
which $f$ has a unique minimizer.

## Question E.4

Let ${\bf C}$ be an $N \times K$ matrix, let $z \in \mathbb{R}$ and consider the function
$f$ from $\mathbb{R}^K$ to $\mathbb{R}$ defined by
%
$$
%
f({\bf x}) = {\bf x}' {\bf C}' {\bf C} {\bf x} + z
%
$$
%
Show that $f$ has a unique minimizer on $\mathbb{R}^K$ if and only if ${\bf C}$
has linearly independent columns.

```{tip}
Obviously, you should
draw intuition from the preceding question. Also, what does linear
independence of the columns of ${\bf C}$ say about the vector ${\bf C}
{\bf x}$ for different choices of ${\bf x}$?
```

## Question E.5

Consider the maximization problem
%
$$
%
\max_{c_1, c_2} ( \sqrt c_1 + \beta \sqrt{c_2})
%
$$
%
subject to $c_1, c_2 \geq 0$ and $p_1 c_1 + p_2 c_2 \leq m$. 
Here $p_1, p_2$ and $m$ are nonnegative constants, and $\beta \in (0, 1)$.

Show that this problem has a solution if and only if $p_1$ and $p_2$ are both
strictly positive.

## Question E.6

Let $A$ be a nonempty bounded set and let $B := \{ b \in \mathbb{R} \colon b = 2a \text{ for some } a \in A\}$.
Obtain $\sup B$ in terms of $\sup A$. Justify your answer.
