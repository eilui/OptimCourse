# Exercise set A

**General comment on the tutorial exercises**

- these questions are not directly assessable and solutions are provided in a separate document
- the aim is to help you better understand the material we have covered so far and start to prepare for actual assessments
- if you are having no particular problems with this course then
please carry on to the questions below; if, on the other hand, you are having difﬁculty with the material, then please read on
- this is an upper level course on mathematics for economists that pushes you beyond the boundaries of the kind of things we do in high school or ﬁrst year university
- many people ﬁnd this material hard at ﬁrst, however, the experience is that anyone who works diligently and consistently can and will do well

Here are few tips on getting through and doing well:

1. It’s hard to “wing" this course, even if you did well at maths in high school. It’s also very hard to follow everything just from the lectures. 
It takes practice to do well, just like playing guitar or learning a language. The ﬁrst resource is the lecture slides, and the more often you read them the more the deﬁnitions will stick and the material will gel in your head.

2. Each time you are having difficulty with a new concept try googling it. Have a look at Wikipedia, find a video on YouTube, or some of the other online resources. They might phrase or explain the concept in a way that ﬁts better with your brain.

3. Work consistently throughout the semester. Concepts become clearer and more familiar the more times that you go over them—with at least one sleep in between to allow your brain to organize neurons and synapses to store and categorize this new information.

4. Make use of your tutors. They are very knowledgable and are willing to put in time to help anyone who is genuinely trying (although much less inclined to help those who aren’t).

5. Send me feedback if you think it’s something I can help with (e.g., more practice questions on a certain topic) or drop in during my ofﬁce hours to discuss.

6. Above all, remember that the course material is nontrivial for a reason. Doing straightforward calculations applying well known rules or memorizing “cookbooks" of facts are not particularly useful, mainly because computers are far, far better than humans at these kinds of activities. What is still very useful—probably more than ever—is understanding concepts and how they relate to each other, and building up your ability to digest technical material and think in a logical way. 
If you complete this course successfully you will have signiﬁcantly upgraded your mathematical skills.

Finally, here are some tips on doing proofs:

1. In many instances there will be an easy way to do things, if you can spot it. A question that seems to require a long calculation will likely have an easy answer if you know the relevant fact.

2. If you feel stuck, remember that the hardest step is getting started, and for proofs the best place to start is always the relevant deﬁnitions. If you are asked to show that the range of a given function is a linear subspace, start by writing down those two deﬁnitions. They will tell you more speciﬁcally what you need to show. If you’re still stuck, review any facts from the lecture slides related to those deﬁnitions. Is there a different way to describe the range of this function? Is there some fact related to linear subspaces that might be helpful?

3. If you’re still stuck, try ﬂipping the problem around. In the previous example, suppose that the range of the function is not a linear subspace. What would that imply? Can you show that such an outcome is impossible?

4. Be patient and don’t rush. You’ll get quicker naturally, with practice.

## Question A.1

Let $f \colon [-1, 1] \to \mathbb{R}$ be defined by $f(x) = 1 - |x|$, where $|x|$ is the absolute value of $x$.  
- Is the point $x = 0$ a maximizer of $f$ on $[-1, 1]$?
- Is it a unique maximizer?
- Is it an interior maximizer?
- Is it stationary?

## Question A.2

Let $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be defined by $f(x) = \sin(x)$.
- Write down the set of stationary points of this function.
- Which of these, if any, are maximizers, and which are minimizers?

```{tip}
When we discussed these kinds of problems it was for functions of the form $f \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$.  Now the domain is all of $\mathbb{R}$.
However you can apply the same definitions and use similar reasoning.  Also, feel free to look up and use any helpful facts on trigonometric functions.

## Question A.3: Profit maximization with Cobb-Douglas production and linear costs

A firm uses capital and labor to produce output. 
When it employs $k$ units of capital and $\ell$ units of labor, its output is $A k^{\alpha} \ell^{\beta}$ units, where $A$ is a positive number, and $\alpha + \beta \le 1$.

The unit price of capital is $r$, and the unit price of labor is $w$; both are non-negative. 
The firm would like to maximize the profits taking the price $p$ of the output as given.

The firm's chief economist *Bob* presented the following formulation of the firm's optimization problem to the CEO *Alice*:

$$
\text{Choose } k, \ell, w \text{ and } r \text{ to maximize } 
p k^{\alpha} \ell^{\beta} - w \ell - r k 
\quad \mathrm{s.t.} \quad
\alpha + \beta \leq 1
$$

Questions:

1. Is this formulation of the firm's optimization problem correct?
  - What part reflects the revenue?
  - What part reflects the costs?
  - What are the choice variables?
  - Are there any constraints to be taken into account?

2. Right down the problem after *Alice* have updated the formulation.

3. Approach the problem as unconstrained maximization, and follow the steps in the lecture to find find all stationary points (solve the FOCs).

4. Write down second order partial derivatives and verify the shape conditions for the profit function.

5. What is the optimal strategy for the firm? Is the maximizer unique? Why?


## Question A.4*

```{note}
Exercises marked with an asterisk **(*)** are optional and more difficult.
```

1. Find all stationary points of the function 
$f(x, y) = \frac{\cos(x^2 + y^2)}{1 + x^2 + y^2}$.

2. Find all maximizers and minimizers of this function on $\mathbb{R}^2$.

```{hint}
Is there a convenient change of variable to convert the problem to a univariate one.
```
