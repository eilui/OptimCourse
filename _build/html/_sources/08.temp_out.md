### Corner Solutions

So far all our solutions have been interior ($x_i > 0$ for $i=1,2$)

Such solutions can be tracked down by the tangency conditions

However sometimes solutions are naturally on the boundaries

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Maximize $x_1 + \log(x_2)$ subject to
```
%
$$
%
p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 = m
\quad \text{and} \quad
x_1, x_2 \geq 0
%
$$
%

Let's try the tangency approach with $p_1=p_2 = 1$ and $m=0.4$

Tangency condition is
%
$$
%
\frac{1}{1/x_2} = \frac{p_1}{p_2} 
\quad \iff \quad
x_2 = \frac{p_1}{p_2} = 1
%
$$
%

Applying the budget constraint gives
%
$$
%
x_1 + x_2 = 0.4
\quad \text{and hence} \quad
x_1 = -0.6
%
$$
%

Meaning: There is no tangent point in 
%
$$
%
D := 
\{ (x_1, x_2) \colon x_1 \geq 0, \; x_2 \geq 0 \text{ and \} p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 = m}
%
$$
%

Tangent point is infeasible
```

Interpretation: No interior solution 

Put differently
%
- At every interior point on the budget line you can do better
- Hence solution must be on the boundary

Since $x_2 = 0$ implies $x_1 + \log(x_2) = - \infty$, solution is 
%
- $x_1^* = 0$
- $x_2^* = m/p_2 = 0.4$
