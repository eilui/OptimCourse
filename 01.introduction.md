# Prerequisites

See [Course overview](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2023/course/ECON2125#terms) and
[Class summary](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/ECON2125/Second%20Semester/6275)

What you actually need to know:
- basic algebra
- basic calculus
- some idea of what a matrix is, etc.

≈ content of EMET1001/EMET7001 math course

# Focus?

*Q:* Is this optimization or a general math-econ course?

*A:* A general course on mathematical modeling for economics and financial economics. Optimization will be an important and recurring theme.

# Assessment

- 3 timed open book tests (15% each)
- Final exam (55%)

The three tests spread out through the semester will check the knowledge of the immediately preceding material. The final closed book in-person exam will cover the entire course.

# Questions

1. Administrative questions: RSE admin

  - **Bronwyn Cammack** Senior School Administrator
  - Email: enquiries.rse@anu.edu.au

  - "I can not register for the tutorial group"

2. Content related questions: please, refer to the tutors

  - "I don't understand why this function is conves"

3. Other questions: to Fedor

  - "I'm working hard but still can not keep up"
  - "Can I please have extra assignment for more practice"

# Attendance

- Please, **do not** use email for *instructional* questions\Instead make use of the office hours

- Attendance of tutorials is *very highly* recommended\
You will make your life much easier this way

- Attendance of lectures is *highly* recommended\
But not mandatory

# Comments for lectures notes/slides

- Cover exactly what you are required to know
- Code inserts are the exception, they are not assessable

In particular, you need to know:
- The definitions from the notes
- The facts from the notes
- How to apply facts and definitions

If a concept in not in the lecture notes, it is not assessable

# Definitions and facts

The lectures notes/slides are full of definitions and facts.

```{admonition} Definition
Functions $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is called *continuous at* $x$ if, for any sequence $\{x_n\}$ converging to $x$, we have $f(x_n) \rightarrow f(x)$.
```

Possible exam question: "Show  that if functions $f$ and $g$ are continuous at $x$, so is $f+g$."

You should start the answer with the definition of continuity: 

"Let $\{x_n\}$ be any sequence converging to $x$. We need to show that $f(x_n) + g(x_n) \rightarrow f(x) + g(x)$. To see this, note that ..."

# Facts

In the lecture notes/slides you will often see

```{admonition} Fact
The only $N$-dimensional subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ is $\mathbb{R}^N$.
```

This means either:
- theorem
- proposition
- lemma
- true statement

All well known results. You need to remember them, have some intuition for, and be able to apply.

# Note on Assessments

Assessable = definitions and facts + last year level math + a few simple steps of logic

Exams and tests will award:
- Hard work
- Deeper understanding of the concepts

In each question there will be a *easy* path to the solution

# Reading materials

**Primary reference:** lecture slides

**Books:**

- "Mathematics for Economists" (1994) by Simon, C. and L. Blume
- "A First Course in Optimization" (1996) Theory by Rangarajan Sundaram 
- "A Primer in Econometric Theory" (2016) by John Stachurski

Readings are supplementary but will provide a more detailed explanation with additional examples.

- Each lecture will reference book chapters

# Key points for the administrative part

- Tutorials start next week, **please register before the next lecture**
- Course content = what’s in lecture notes/slides
- Lecture slides are available online and will be updated throughout the semester
- Optimization is a recurring theme but not the only topic

# What you will learn in the course

- The lecture plan is on the course website [optim.iskh.me](https://optim.iskh.me) and [Class summary](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/ECON2125/Second%20Semester/6275)

- See the list of topics on the left

Essentially:

1. **Mathematical foundations**
  - elements of analysis
  - elements of linear algebra
  - elements of probability

2. **Optimization theory**
  - when solution exists
  - unconstrained optimization
  - optimization with equality constraints
  - optimization with inequality constraints

3. **Further topics**
  - Parameterized optimization problems
  - Optimization in dynamics

# Further material and self-learning

- Each lecture will suggest some material for further reading and learning

- Today: **The Wason Selection Task** logical problem

- Mathematics relies on rules of logic
- Yet, for human brain applying mathematical logic may be difficult, and dependent on the domain
