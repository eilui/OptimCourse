# Exercise set B

Please, see the 
[**general comment on the tutorial exercises**](02.exercises.md)

## Question B.1

Each of the definitions below is an attempt to define a set. Determine whether a set is indeed defined in each case, and if not explain why.

1. $\{1,e,-2,-\pi\}$
1. $\{15,\{1,2,3\},\text{ANU},\text{Europe},\text{USA}\}$
1. $\{1,2,\dots,99 \}$
1. $\{1,4,7,91, \dots \}$
1. $\{x \in \mathbb{R} \colon x^2 \le 5\}$
1. $\{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \colon 5x^2 + y^2 \le 10\}$
1. $\{f \colon [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \colon f \text{ is one-to-one} \}$
1. $\{ f_n(x) \colon [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \colon f_n(x) = x^n \}$
1. $\{A \subset S : x_0 \in A \}$ for given $S$ and $x_0 \in S$


## Question B.2

Let $A$,$B$ and $C$ be any three sets.
Show that $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A\cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$.

```{hint}
Hint, if you need it: One way to show that $E=F$ is show that a arbitrary element of $E$ must also be in $F$ and vice versa.
```

## Question B.3

Let $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ be some set such that $A \subset C$ and $B \subset C$.
Let $f\colon D \rightarrow C$ be a function.

Show that $f^{-1}(A \setminus B) = f^{-1}(A) \setminus f^{-1}(B)$.

## Question B.4

Find the composition $g \circ f$ of two functions $f$ and $g$, if it exists:

1. $f \colon \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x)=\sin(x)$ and $g \colon \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by $g(x)= \frac{x}{1+x^2}$

2. $f \colon \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x)= 1-x^4$ and $g \colon (1,\infty) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by $g(x)= \log(x-1)$

3. $f \colon \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x)=\cos(x)$ and $g \colon \mathbb{R}\setminus\{1\} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by $g(x)= \frac{x}{1-x}$


```{hint}
Is there a composition in each case?
```

## Question B.5

Let $f$ and $g$ be any two functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$.  Is it true that
$g \circ f = f \circ g$ always holds?

```{hint}
There are two
things implicit in this question.  First, there is an implicit final
sentence here, which is: If yes, prove it.  If no, give a
counterexample.  Second, an equality sign between two functions means
that they are the same function.  Hence to show equality you need to
show that they agree everywhere on the domain.  To show inequality,
you need to give just one point in the domain where the function
values differ.
```

## Question B.6

```{admonition} Fact: the sufficient conditions for concavity/convexity in 2D

Let $z = f(x,y)$ be a twice continuously differentiable function defined for all
$(x, y) \in R^2$.

Then it holds:

- $f \text{ is convex } \iff f''_{1,1} \ge 0, \; f''_{2,2} \ge 0 , \text{ and } f''_{1,1} f''_{2,2} − (f′′_{1,2})^2 \ge 0$

- $f \text{ is concave } \iff f''_{1,1} \le 0, \; f''_{2,2} \le 0 , \text{ and } f''_{1,1} f''_{2,2} − (f′′_{1,2})^2 \ge 0$

- $f''_{1,1} > 0 \text{ and } f''_{1,1} f''_{2,2} \implies f \text{ is strictly convex}$

- $f''_{1,1} < 0 \text{ and } f''_{1,1} f''_{2,2} \implies f \text{ is strictly concave}$

```

1. Find the largest domain $S$ on which 
$f(x, y) = x^2 − y^2 − xy − x^3$ is concave.
2. How about strictly concave?
